Name: Daryl AlexStudent ID: 143691202Email: dalex4@myseneca.caProfessor: Jeevan PantUpon able to successful completion of this workshop, I was able to learn as to how to manage polymorphic objects using the vector container of the STL, I was also able to dynamically move an allocated object into a container, I also learned to code a range-based iteration on the objects in a container. I was also able to expand and improve my coding abilities on reporting and handling an exception. The concept of inclusion polymorphism was implemented, as both the directory and file module inherited from the resource module. I was able to declare a vector and learn its uses of modifying an element. The vectors were used in the Directory module. The concept of dynamic cast has been implemented so as to call the directory module alone without invoking the resource or the file module.
