The move assignment is used to transfer a temporary object to an existing object, moreover it can be overloaded whereas copy operator is the copying of the actual data of the object to another object rather than making another object point to the exiting object thus saving a significant time difference. I was able to implement this concept into my workshop which is ProteinDatabase::ProteinDatabase(ProteinDatabase&& old){   *this = std::move(old);}
