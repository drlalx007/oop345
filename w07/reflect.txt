Name: Daryl AlexStudent ID: 143691202Email: dalex4@myseneca.caProfessor: Jeevan PantUpon able to complete this workshop successfully, I was able to copy data from a file into a sequential container, I was also able to use the numeric library to accumulate data values, I was able to set a lambda expression to specify an operation on each value in a data set and I was also able to use the algorithm library to sort data values.In my workshop, the types of elements in the vector used by me is the covid objects. The type of value that I passing as the replacement value for the vectors that is the covid objects is the STL algorithms.Some of the STL function that I used in this workshop is for_each, copy_if, any_of, sort. These functions count the number of occurrences of the given value. I used the STL algorithms and not the looping functions because STL algorithms is the only value that can be used as an replacement values for the vector objects.
