Name: Daryl AlexStudent ID: 143691202Email: dalex4@myseneca.caUpon able to successfully completion of the part 1 and part 2 of this workshop,   I was able to implement a lot of programming accepts, which includes accessing a variable defined in a translation unit, I was able to declare a local variable that resides in the memory throughout the lifetime of the program, I was able to receive the program arguments from the command line and in a translation unit I was able to prevent a class definition from duplication. I am now able to differentiate between the internal and external linkage eg. From my code for the   external linkage is extern double c_tax_rate;extern double c_discount;The example for internal linkage is static size_t numOrders = 0;Static variables is a variable that is used in allocated one time and which is used for the entirety of the program and the lifetime of the variable is the lifetime of the program. The changes that I made in upgrading the foodorder in part 2 is the implementation of the string functions which I had used to find the length of the string by pointing a particular character and two other string functions. The part 1 of the workshop was comparatively less challenging when compared to the part 2 as I had a lot of compilation errors when compiling the part 2. Some of the errors included are the common coding errors that I had made, also I had some errors when compiling the static variables as I did not initialize it correctly.
