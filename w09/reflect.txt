I was also able to understand and enhance my abilities to process partitioned data on two or more threads, I was also able to write a set of numbers to a file in binary mode. I am now understanding how to read a set of numbers from a file in binary mode and to bind a function to its arguments. There was a lot of benefit from using a binary file rather than using a text file in this workshop because, the compiler understands the binary language and therefore we do not need to convert the data into binary format and hence the code becomes much simpler and is not so lengthy. The advantages of using multithreading in this workshop is that it simplifies the code and it also it also improves performance and concurrency.
