The project was divided into 3 milestones, and each milestone grew challenging as I started completing it. I also learned the development of the simulation of an assembly line with three number of stations. The assembly line is made up of a series of workstations, each of which is equipped with its own set of stock items. At the request of the consumer, a line manager moves orders along the line, filling them at each station. Each customer order has a list of goods that must be fulfilled. If the next order in the queue demands the station's item and that item is in stock, each station fills it. The line manager continues to move customer orders from station to station until they are all processed. Any station that has depleted its stock of items will be unable to fulfil any additional orders.
